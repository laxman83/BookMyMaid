                    Hiring a home nurse is a less expensive option than making
                    an extended stay in the hospitals. It will help elderly
                    patients to stay in their own home getting necessary care
                    from a home nurse. Nowadays, due to the increased number of
                    nuclear families, it becomes impossible to offer the care
                    and attention required by your dear and near ones.
